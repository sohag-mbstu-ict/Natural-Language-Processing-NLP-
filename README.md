NLP Text preprocessing is a method to clean the text in order to make it ready to feed to models. Noise in the text comes in varied forms like emojis, punctuations, different cases. All these noises are of no use to machines and hence need to clean it.

These are some text preprocessing steps that we can add or remove as per the dataset we have:

Step-1 : Remove newlines & Tabs

Step-2 : Strip HTML Tags

Step-3 : Remove Links

Step-4 : Remove Whitespaces

Step-6 : Case Conversion

Step-7 : Reducing repeated characters and punctuations

Step-8 : Expand Contractions

Step-9 : Remove Special Characters

Step-10: Remove Stopwords

Step-11: Correcting Mis-spelled words

Step-12: Lemmatization / Stemming
